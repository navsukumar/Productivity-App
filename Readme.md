This is a website that I created to help me practice web development skills. Featured is a page with a counter that updates when the increment and decrement buttons are clicked, as well as a To-do-list widget where you can create and delete To-dos. I have also created another page called "I'm bored" where when you click on the "I'm bored" button, it will make an api call to the Bored API and fetch a random activity to do.
