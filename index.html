      <h3>How I made it</h3>
      <p>
        This project was made using HTML, CSS, and Java Script. HTML was used to build the DOM, CSS was used 
        to style the DOM elements, and Java Script was used to handle the API interactions and implement the 
        functionalities of each of the buttons.
